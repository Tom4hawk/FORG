Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.  Please
see the file COPYING or visit http://www.gnu.org/ for more details.
One of the things that the COPYING file is going to tell you is that I
am not responsible for anything that may happen as a result of running
this program.

Please read the section "IN ORDER TO RUN THE FORG" below on how to get
this running.  (Hint:  python, Tkinter, and Pmw, and you're there)

FORG is a graphical gopher client.  To run the program, run:

./forg.py host

as an example, host can be "gopher.floodgap.com",
"gopher.heatdeath.org", or "gopher.quux.org", which are all 3 valid
gopher sites.  Alternately, you can use URL syntax, as in:

./forg gopher://gopher.quux.org

---=== Features ===---

Everything listed here actually does work, well at least most of the
time.  Please see the BUGS file to find out about what doesn't work.

- Ability to load other programs with different file formats.
  I.e. this program does not interpret HTML, so you may want to
  associate .html files with mozilla, so it will be launched upon
  saving a .html file.
- Full caching of directories and files
- Searching supported.  (Tested against gopher.floodgap.com's
  Veronica, but of course)
- Bookmark support.  Bookmarks are written in XBEL and support
  arbitrary folders and subfolders.
- Bookmark editing, similar to netscape
- Directories are searchable by name.
- Statistics on size of cache, number of files in the cache, and
  number of documents in the queue.
- Ability to save files and directories.  (Note: when directories are
  saved, the protocol information that the server sent is what is
  saved to disk...for now)
- ASK menus - users can interract with programs on foreign servers
  through the use of miniature questionnaires.
- Right click context menus on all items providing all available
  information on a resource.  (If the server supports Gopher+)
- Between 0 and 100% complete implementation of Gopher *AND*
  Gopher+!!! :)
- Managerspeak.  This program leverages automatic internet data retrieval
  and storaging technologies for quasi-reliable interlocked handshake
  protocol interaction, allowing open-ended failsafe solutions to be
  developed in the realm of...oh whatever.

Please email me with information on anything that the program does
that you don't think it should do.  (Like penning filthy Russian
novels, provoking arab/israeli hostilities, breaking your toaster, or
causing a MIDI rendition of "Yankee Doodle" to be played backwards
through your speakers)

---=== IN ORDER TO RUN THE FORG ===---

You will need 3 things.  Python, Tkinter, and Pmw.  If you have an up
to date linux system, chances are good that you have python and
Tkinter already.  If you don't, you can download them from
http://www.python.org/.  The version of python required is 1.5.2, and
the version of Tkinter required is the latest.  Python version 2.0 is
strongly suggested.

To obtain Pmw, do one of several things:

Pmw's page is located at:
http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/
There you will find extensive instructions on downloading it and
installing it.  The instructions here should be sufficient though.  

Download the actual package from
http://download.sourceforge.net/pmw/Pmw.0.8.5.tar.gz
This is the latest version that was used for development.  You could
possibly skate by with an earlier version (I haven't tried it) but
why?

If you're using debian, you can just type "apt-get install python-pmw"
and let the package management system do all of the dirty work for
you. 

To install Pmw, just unzip it into your python's library directory.
For most people, this will be something like
/usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages/ or something similar.

Theoretically, this program should run under windows.  I haven't tried
it, so don't be suprised if it dies horribly.  But do email me.
