- Optionally make use of PIL if it is installed (Python Imaging
  Library).  I don't know how well this is going to work across
  platforms though.  This could be used to display jpeg/gif/png when
  downloaded rather than using a launching program.
- Maybe work in an alternative to GUIDirectory for listing things in
  an icon-list fashion.
- Add Options editor.  (See Options.py -- there are a number of
  configurable options, but no way to do that yet)
- Improve associations editor.
- Make it irrelevant whether users enter URLs or hostnames for
  starting points.  (This will probably disallow interpretation as a
  local flie)
- Support bookmark subfolders
- Write bookmark handling widget  (add/delete/rename/folders, etc)
- Do more with information from server on different resources.
  (i.e. more than just block separation and presenting it to the user
  in a dialog)
