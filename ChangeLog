Changes since version 0.5
	- Fixed short read for gopher servers that misreport the content
	  lengths of documents.  FORG now totally disregards content
	  lenghts since they are so unreliable.

Changes since version 0.4.1
	- Added the 'delete' feature in the Bookmark Editor.
	- Bookmarks now reload after the editor widget is destroyed.
	- Fixed "inactive bookmark menu" problem when reloading bookmark
	  menu.
	- Added many more docstrings to the source.
	- Fixed URL parsing bug on startup.  Previously the program
	  mishandled fully qualified URLs as arguments, now it doesn't.
	- Added option:  delete cache on exit
	- Added option:  home.  
	- Added "Home" button on toolbar and "Set this site as my home
	  site" option in the options menu.

Changes since version 0.4:
	- Fixed Makefile bug pointed out by stain <sta1n@libero.it>
	- Fixed Python 2.1 compatibility bug pointed out by stain
	<sta1n@libero.it> 
	- Migrated all regsub.[g]sub calls to re.sub
	- Fixed other Python 2.1 compatibility issues in Tree.py

Changes since version 0.3:
	- Added the ability to select fonts/colors with
	  $HOME/.forg/options
	- Fixed critical bug that was causing directory creation errors on
	  windows systems.
	- Fixed fatal bug if the options file didn't exist.  Whoops.  :)
	- Fixed several bookmark editor bugs including disallowing cutting
	  the root node, adding error dialogs for inactive conditions
	  (like when the user tries to paste and no node is on the
	  clipboard)
	- Disabled menu tearoffs.  If anybody really wants them, I'll make
	  them an option, but they seem to confuse windows users, and
	  they're not exactly a super useful innovation.  :)
	- Small GUI tweaks.
	
Changes since version 0.2:
	Many bugfixes to the bookmark editor, including:
	- pasting folders into other folders
	- inserting folders as siblings of other folders
	- editing bookmarks and folder names in their places
	Display bugfixes, including a fix for some menu lockups.
	
	Program redesign - rather than having most of the logic of the
	program in TkGui, it has been separated out into a module allowing
	the FORG to be embedded in other applications.

	Improved caching and directory creation

	Addition of "purge cache" and "query cache" features.

Changes since version 0.1:
	Added the "Purge Cache" functionality, which does the equivalent
	of a "rm -rf" on the users cache directory, which is usually
	$HOME/.forg/cache/.

	Added the "Cache Statistics" functionality to count
	files/directories and total filesize.

	Added support for the PIL (Python Imaging Library).  If you have
	this software installed, it will be used to display images
	supported by the PIL inside the FORG's window when selecting
	images.  This will only happen if you don't have an application
	bound to that filetype, and if the "Use PIL" option is checked.

	Added rudimentary bookmark editor, which isn't working yet, but
	gives you an idea of what it will be like.

	Added the Tree widget written by Charles E. "Gene" Cash
	<gcash@fdn.com>.  Used in the Bookmark Editor.
