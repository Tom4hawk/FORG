Current known bugs in FORG:

- Some dialog menus have to have their titlebar clicked or be resized
  before they will actually appear.  This looks like a Pmw thing.
- Find facility for text files works, but it doesn't show the user the
  result, so for all practical purposes it doesn't work.  :)
- Find facility on directories works, but if the item found wasn't on
  the screen, you may have to scroll down to find it.
- Random python segfaults seem to happen occasionally due to Pmw.  I
  cannot trace this.  If you are able to get a core file out of python
  and this happens to you, please email it to me. (Along with info on
  the version of python you're running)
- Sometimes (rarely) windows will not appear, and there will be an
  unhandled exception thrown through Pmw's convoluted scrolling code.
  I'm having a hell of a time tracing this too, but it should be done
  with eventually.
- Under some strange circumstances, the program may crash when
  launching an external application to deal with a file.
- The "STOP" button doesn't work.
- If the program is abnormally killed, it may leave spawned processes
  behind, despite its best efforts not to.
