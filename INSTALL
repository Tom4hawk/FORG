TO INSTALL THE FORG:

There isn't really any installation procedure.  If you wish, you can
copy all of the program files to a different directory.  But other
than that, there is no installation, simply run the "forg.py" script.
Typing "make install" at the prompt will create a ".forg" directory in
your $HOME directory, and copy the default bookmarks into their proper
location, but it won't change the location of any of the files in this
directory. 

No matter what you do, when you run the program, directories
underneath your $HOME will be created to save the program's
information, settings, bookmarks, and to hold cached data.  That
directory will be $HOME/.forg
